## OVERVIEW

Busybus was a partial project meant to solve a single problem, overcrowding at an intersection of a bus route in a bustling city. The project was limited in scope and drew upon previous designs that were submitted in earlier checkpoints, but added a research element to it, as well as a final presentation of work within the project. 

## PROBLEM

> Transit officials have identified a problem they would like to solve. Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have been recently added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.
> 
> Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.
> 
> (from checkpoint material)

## SOLUTION

The solution I came up with built upon previous mockups in earlier checkpoints, and with the help of research methods such as a user survey and a competitive analysis of competing products. During the testing, a number of topics were surveyed and commented on by users, and influenced the design of the screens. The design process continued to user stores, refined sketches and mockups, a user test with a prototype, and feedback that influenced further revisions. A simple HTML prototype was a final deliverable for this project.
